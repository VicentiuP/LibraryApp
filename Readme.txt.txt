LibraryApp is a simple application for managing a public library.

There are three types of users:
- admin - can manage employees, clients and the library (by default -> User: admin, Pass: 0000)
- employees - can manage clients and the library (by default -> User: emp, Pass: 0000)
- customers - a very simple form in which they can reserve books (by default -> User: user, Pass: 0000).
